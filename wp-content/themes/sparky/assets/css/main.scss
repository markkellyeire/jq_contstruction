| Main stylesheet
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| This is the main stylesheet file. It should have no styles in it but it
| should import all the required files from the SMACSS-categorised
| categories. The explanation for the layout is as follows:
| 
| BASE
| This is where all the base styles live; resets, element defaults,
| default font sizes, etc. This category is mainly dominated by element
| selectors. You should always ask yourself if a ruleset must live in
| base in order to not lose flexibility down the road.
| 
| LAYOUT
| In this section you specify all types of layout containers, such as
| header, footer, content, sidebar, etc. The layout elements haven't got
| any styles applied to them, they only divide the website into sections.
| This is the layer where grid systems etc, would be living.
| 
| MODULES
| The bulk of your css is made up of independent modules and submodules.
| Every module should be completely independent of its context and should
| work within any layout container or other module.
| 
| If a specific context requires changes to a module you rather create
| a submodule that describes the context instead changing styles based
| on the parent.
| 
| STATE
| Modules can be in different types of states: class-based-states(.is-active),
| pseudo-classes(:hover, :focus), attribute states(data-state="rotating"),
| or @mediaquery states.
| These states belong directly to the modules but have a different category
| because the have their own naming convention and usage rules.
| 
| THEME
| SMACSS points to an optional fifth category, theme, but this is only
| applicable to pages that require theming. Theme styles override or extend
| the modules, and only apply colors and backgrounds.
| 
| VENDOR
| Any external libraries or plugin files should reside in the vendor directory.
